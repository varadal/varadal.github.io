I wanted to move away from Jekyll since I don&#39;t particularly care for Ruby, so I turned to Hugo. &#40;~ Feb 2021&#41;</p> <p>And now I&#39;ve turned to Franklin.jl. Its been a while since I set up my website in Hugo, and recently I found that I completely forgot how it was set up and how to get it running again. Instead of learning how Hugo works I looked around for other static site generators, I think thiking about moving back to Jekyll or Hexo &#40;which would give me the opportunity to improve my node skills&#41;. This didn&#39;t happen since I learned about Franklin.jl, its written in a language that I actually like: Julia. So now &#40;Jan 7th 2022&#41; I have a website in Julia.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Lalit Varada. Last modified: January 08, 2022.
