Hello, this is my first post using Hugo. I wanted to move away from Jekyll since I don't particularly care for Ruby, so I turned to Hugo. (~ Feb 2021)

Hi again, now I've switched to Franklin.jl. Its been a while since I set up my website in Hugo, and recently I found that I completely forgot how to add more posts. Instead of learning how Hugo works or trying to understand the build workflow that I obtained from a random youtube video I looked around for other static site generators. Well, I didn't give up immediately, but I wanted to use this as an excuse to change static site generators. I was thinking about moving back to Jekyll, or trying out Hexo (which would give me the opportunity to improve my node skills), but the moment I learned of Franklin.jl I knew I wanted to use it.
For one, its actually written in a language that I know how to write. The second reason was that all of the templates just seemed to be simpler imo, and all of the themes that people were generally using were came from the same github repo, making it easier to get and try out new themes. Most of all I really like Julia.
