Hey, this is my first post using Hugo. I wanted to move away from Jekyll since I don't particularly care for Ruby, so I turned to Hugo. (~ Feb 2021)

And now I've turned to Franklin.jl. Its been a while since I set up my website in Hugo, and recently I found that I completely forgot how it was set up and how to get it running again. Instead of learning how Hugo works I looked around for other static site generators, I think thiking about moving back to Jekyll or Hexo (which would give me the opportunity to improve my node skills). This didn't happen since I learned about Franklin.jl, its written in a language that I actually like: Julia. So now (Jan 7th 2022) I have a website in Julia.
