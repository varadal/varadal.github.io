## Spiral not Circle

"Time is a flat circle," is a phrase usually said when referring to a pop-culture or political topic that seemed to already been hashed out a few years ago but popped up again. It’s a pretty cool phrase, but somewhat superficial. I’ve always liked “time is a spiral" more, though it isn’t as cheeky. It captures that fact that some events are reminiscent of the past while being different in their own way. This stuff is pretty obvious, but I get a sense of comfort from the idea that we're in a spiral rather than a circle, slowly, but surely correcting our mistakes. It lets me believe that we're not damned to see our mistakes repeated forever.
