## Spiral not Circle

"Time is a flat circle," they usually say this when referring to pop-culture or political topic that seemed to already been hashed out a few years ago but popped up again. Its a pretty cool phrase, but somewhat superficial. "Time is a spiral" works a bit better in my opinion, it captures that fact that something is reminiscent of the past while being different in its own way. This stuff is pretty obvious, but I get a sense of comfort from the idea that we're in a spiral rather than a circle. It lets me believe that we're not damned to see our mistakes repeated in the exact same manner forever. The phrase also gets me to view topics in the news more critically, since I may be missing what makes the topic unique from the last time it was in vogue.
