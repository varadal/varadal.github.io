It’s a pretty cool phrase, but somewhat superficial. I’ve always liked “time is a spiral&quot; more, though it isn’t as cheeky. It captures that fact that some events are reminiscent of the past while being different in their own way. This stuff is pretty obvious, but I get a sense of comfort from the idea that we&#39;re in a spiral rather than a circle, slowly, but surely correcting our mistakes. It lets me believe that we&#39;re not damned to see our mistakes repeated forever.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Lalit Varada. Last modified: February 15, 2022.
