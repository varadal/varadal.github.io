Its a pretty cool phrase, but somewhat superficial. &quot;Time is a spiral&quot; works a bit better in my opinion, it captures that fact that something is reminiscent of the past while being different in its own way. This stuff is pretty obvious, but I get a sense of comfort from the idea that we&#39;re in a spiral rather than a circle. It lets me believe that we&#39;re not damned to see our mistakes repeated in the exact same manner forever. The phrase also gets me to view topics in the news more critically, since I may be missing what makes the topic unique from the last time it was in vogue.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Lalit Varada.
